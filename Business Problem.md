## Introduction/Business Problem

In this project we will try to find an optimal location for a towing service. Specifically, this report will be targeted to stakeholders interested in opening an Towing Service Campany in Seattle, USA.

Since there are lots of towing service in Seattle we will try to detect locations that are have most car collisions in past. We are also particularly interested in most severity case location. We would also prefer locations to bad road candition in different weather, assuming that first two conditions are met.

We will use  data science to generate a few most promissing neighborhoods based on this criteria. Advantages of each area will then be clearly expressed so that best possible final location can be chosen by stakeholders.
