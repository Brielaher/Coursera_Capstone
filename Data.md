This analysis model will be carried out taking into account a variety of attributes of the Data-Collision.csv file which includes many important and historical factors of 
accidents such as the state of the road, the weather at the time of the event, and more.
We will build a model that understands these factors and, in turn, can make a prediction of the severity of a car accident based on those same attributes.
